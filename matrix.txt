START  
    SAY "Enter the size of the square matrix (n)"  
    TAKE n from the user  
    MAKE a matrix called m1 of size n  
    MAKE a matrix called m2 of size n

HOW TO FILL A MATRIX:  
    FOR each row from 1 to n  
        FOR each column from 1 to n  
            TAKE number from user and put it in the right place  
        END  
    END  
HOW TO SHOW A MATRIX:  
    FOR each row from 1 to n  
        FOR each column from 1 to n  
            PRINT the number  
        END  
        GO to a new line  
    END  
HOW TO MULTIPLY TWO MATRICES:  
    MAKE a new matrix called result, fill it with zeros  
    FOR each row from 1 to n  
        FOR each column from 1 to n  
            result[row][column] = 0  
            FOR each k from 1 to n  
                MULTIPLY m1[row][k] with m2[k][column]  
                ADD this to result[row][column]  
            END  
        END  
    END  
    RETURN result
